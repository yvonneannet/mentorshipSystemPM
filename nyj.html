    <p> In this book,  Trevor Noah shares his experiences as a mixed-race child in apartheid South Africa, where being born of a black mother and a white father was against the law and punishable. The book's title itself shows how Noah's very birth was seen as illegal and he further describes it as such.</br></br>

        The first chapter looks at how Noah's mother had to hide him to keep him safe from the government, which could have taken him away because of his mixed heritage. This story of hiding and survival is similar to what many people in my home district of Gulu, Northern Uganda,  experienced from the civil war that took place between 1986- 2006. In Gulu, families often had to move secretly and live hidden during the long periods of conflict, showing great bravery and resilience.</br></br>
        
        The second chapter, "Born a Crime," talks about Noah’s struggle to find where he fits in a society that has a  different view of who he is. He doesn't fully belong to any group since he lies in between two races. This feeling of not fitting in is something many people in Gulu can relate to, especially considering the region's diverse ethnic backgrounds that have sometimes led to discrimination. Many people in my district often find it hard to fit in well and this makes life uncomfortable for some people.
        
        Overall, the first two chapters of "Born a Crime" connect well with the experiences of people in Gulu, where fighting against unfair rules and searching for one’s identity are common themes. Noah’s stories show the challenges and strengths that come from growing up in such tough conditions, much like the stories from Gulu during the 1986 civil war.
